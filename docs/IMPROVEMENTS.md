## Block B — A second platform: jcloud checks a tree that is not the Japode one

### §JCT10 A second platform in the contract tests

The harness landed: platform_test.go reads JCLOUD_PLATFORM as a list, runs every
TestCommitted test once per tree through that tree's jcloud.yml, keeps the tests about
Japode's own scripts to a tree with no jcloud.yml, and ci/check.sh mounts each tree in
`JCLOUD_PLATFORM=../cloud:../../viglet/cloud` and skips an absent one.

What is left is jcloud's own CI. .github/workflows/ci.yml checks out no platform, so
there every contract test skips. Japode/cloud and openviglet/cloud are both private, so
checking them out needs a read-only token as a repository secret (a fine-grained PAT
with contents:read on the two, or a GitHub App installed on both orgs). With it, ci.yml
gains two `actions/checkout` steps into sibling paths and passes their list to
ci/check.sh. Which credential, and who owns it, is the user's decision.

Before Viglet Cloud's tree is useful there it needs its own adoption, filed in its own
roadmap: a jcloud.yml, manifests for turing, shio and dumont, its check script writing
.deploy-state/nginx-T.txt and .deploy-state/compose-config.json (platform_test.go names
them), and JCT18 and JCT20 shipped here. Until it carries a jcloud.yml it is read as the
Japode layout and fails the Japode-script tests, which is the right answer for a tree
that has not said what it is.

### §JCT19 One compose path: the model

Since JCT4, `agree --compose` reads the model `docker compose --profile '*' config
--no-interpolate --format json` prints, and without it falls back to agreeCompose and
agreeNeeds over services/<name>/docker-compose.yml as text (compose_model.go). The
Japode platform's scripts/check-jcloud.sh passes only `--adapted`, so its services still
go through the substring path, which passes on a commented-out line.

Measured on 2026-11-10: the model built from the top-level docker-compose.yml plus every
services/*/docker-compose.yml, joined with `-f` the way scripts/deploy.sh joins them,
agrees for all three Japode services and both their databases. So the change is in the
platform's script: build that model into .deploy-state/compose-config.json (the path
platform_test.go reads) and pass it with `--compose`. jcloud then reports an absent
model the way it reports absent routes ("not supplied, so unchecked"), and the textual
compose and needs checks are deleted, leaving one code path.

The same script edit passes `-e GITHUB_ACTIONS` to go_run's `docker run`. Since JCT17
jcloud prints annotations only when that variable is "true", and the container starts
without it, so the platform's CI loses them at the first pin bump past JCT17 unless it
is passed through.

The two repositories land in order: the platform script first, then the jcloud release
that drops the fallback, or the platform's CI turns red on a model it never built.

### §JCT21 A compose environment value that is a number

Seen 2026-11-10 adopting v0.3.0 in Viglet Cloud (its C190). `docker compose --profile
'*' config --no-interpolate --format json` keeps a value written unquoted as a JSON
number (`PORT: 2700`, `SERVER_PORT: 2720`), and the compose specification allows numbers
and booleans in an `environment` map. `agree --compose` then stops at the decode: `json:
cannot unmarshal number into Go struct field composeService.services.environment of type
string`, and nothing else about any manifest is compared.

Decode each environment value as any JSON scalar and render it the way compose does (a
number as written, a boolean as `true` or `false`, null as unset) before comparing it
with the manifest. The list form (`- KEY=value`) is unaffected.

Done when that model decodes and `agree` reports on the manifests it carries.
